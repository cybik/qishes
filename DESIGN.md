# Design ideas and considerations

## Launcher of Launchers

* Add "Select initial Launcher executable" to bootstrap an install
* Add "Select additional Launcher executable"
* Add mode where multiple launchers live within the compatdata space
* Add "launcher selection" so they can stay independent and can be "switched to"

All of the above leads to "bootstrapper mode" where All hoyoes under one launcher
instance can live in their corner, but then so can WuWa, Strinova, Nikki etc
